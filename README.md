# About

Currently, I have to work with Azure besides seasoned virtualisation.

These is a growing collection of helpers I use. It will grow with my
understanding and needs with this... product.

This is an AzureCLI-only approach. It may or may not eventually cease.

# Location

If you find this on GitHub - this is a fork from outside GitHub. Its
upstream is on a non-Microsoft git. (Details may follow - right now
it's on a public but privately maintained git server, it may be migrated
to a public FOSS instance like Codeberg or whatnot.)
